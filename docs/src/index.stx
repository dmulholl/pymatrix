---

Pymatrix is a lightweight matrix library built in Python. It supports a range of basic linear algebra operations.

::: code python

    from pymatrix import matrix

    m = matrix([
        [1, 2],
        [3, 4]
    ])

    a = m + m * 2
    b = m * m
    c = m ** 3

    d = m.det()
    e = m.inv()

See the [guide](@root/guide//) for a list of available matrix methods.


### Installation


Install directly from the Python package index using `pip`:

    $ pip install pymatrix

Pymatrix requires Python 3.4 or later. The package has no dependencies.


### Command Line


Pymatrix doubles as a simple command line matrix analysis utility. Installing via `pip` automatically makes `pymatrix` available on the command line:

    Usage: pymatrix [OPTIONS] [FLAGS]

      Matrix analysis utility. Enter a matrix interactively at
      the terminal or pipe to stdin from a file, e.g.

        $ pymatrix < matrix.txt

      Elements are parsed as fractions (rational numbers) by
      default. An alternative parser can be specified using
      the --parser flag.

    Options:
      -p, --parser <str>    One of 'int', 'float', 'complex',
                            or 'fraction'.

    Flags:
          --help            Print the application's help text.
          --version         Print the application's version.
